I was planning to write this one for quite some time now. Most recently some of my colleagues were having a discussion on why we should never use jQuery anymore and they believe most people in JS communities also agree with the same. I agree to some extent that we should not use jQuery, but the reason I think would be the difference in how we are developing the Web apps now compared to few years back, and instead of saying we should not use it, its rather we may not need to use it.

As jQuery is a DOM manipulation library and has maintained the same over the years. However the Web Development has shifted focus from libraries to full fledge frameworks (under the SPA) like Angular and React.

I believe that the jQuery may not be as relevant in current Web Development as it used to be, but over the years it has definitely helped people take learnings from it and applied to many modern JS libraries/frameworks.

### Current Usage of jQuery

> _As of 2015, jQuery remains the most widely used JavaScript library on the Web_ — [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JQuery)

As per the below graph, as of Nov 2016, jQuery is still used by ~71% of Top 10k sites, more detail [here](https://trends.builtwith.com/javascript/jQuery).

While writing this I came across a recent article-conversation between some expert Web Developers.

[**Is jQuery Still Relevant? -**  
_Although jQuery's heyday may have passed, the library is still used at a staggering rate. But how of much of that usage…_developer.telerik.com](http://developer.telerik.com/featured/is-jquery-still-relevant/ "http://developer.telerik.com/featured/is-jquery-still-relevant/")[](http://developer.telerik.com/featured/is-jquery-still-relevant/)

### So should I use jQuery (in 2016)!!!

It depends. If you are developing a complex web app then you would be using one of the modern frameworks and may not need jQuery at all. However for simple web sites where you do not have any existing frameworks in place, I think jQuery would still fit good.

> We, as web developers, owe a lot to jQuery. It’s an incredibly mature project, another feature that not many other projects can claim. It has reached a point where it doesn’t need to add more functions to be useful. It’s in fact “removing” them (e.g. the slim version). So, thank you jQuery and the whole community behind it — [**Aurelio De Rosa**](https://github.com/AurelioDeRosa)
