I recently cleared two more AWS certifications and took the tally to total 4 out of 5 main certifications in last 6 months.

There was no plan to do either of them, but I figured it would be helpful and I will learn something new along the way.

### How to Prepare

If you are planning to appear for any of the certifications whether its Solution Architect of SysOps/DevOps, I would highly recommend doing Hands-On Practical Exercises, instead of only reading through the whitepapers and finding easy dumps over the Internet.

By practicing and implementing the services on your own will give you a lot of idea over their internal workings.

Whitepapers and Practice Exams are equally important, so do not miss them. I read a lot of whitepapers from AWS and it added a lot to my learnings and overall experience. You will be definitely blown away by the magic AWS pulls in the background for some of the services.

I have been using AWS since mid-2015, initially for just Lambda and API Gateway to build serverless microservices, but it has become an integral part of any application I have worked on since then.
