In my previous article, we discussed how to setup Jenkins

[**Setup Jenkins on CentOS with Docker for Selenium**  
_I havenâ€™t found any walk-through about setting up Jenkins on CentOS with Docker for Selenium, and since I got to do itâ€¦_medium.com](https://medium.com/appgambit/setup-jenkins-on-centos-with-docker-for-selenium-b7dba07b9ffa "https://medium.com/appgambit/setup-jenkins-on-centos-with-docker-for-selenium-b7dba07b9ffa")[](https://medium.com/appgambit/setup-jenkins-on-centos-with-docker-for-selenium-b7dba07b9ffa)

In this article, I talk about how can we configure SSH authentication between Github and Jenkins so letâ€™s start the discussion.

### Generate SSH Key on JenkinsÂ Server

First, we create a directory named `Github`on the Jenkins server and hidden directory ssh under that:

\-bash-4.2$ mkdir Github  
\-bash-4.2$ cd Github/  
\-bash-4.2$ mkdir .ssh  
\-bash-4.2$ ls -al  
total 4  
drwxrwxr-x. 3 jenkins jenkins 19 Aug 22 23:33 .  
drwxr-xr-x. 30 jenkins jenkins 4096 Aug 22 23:33 ..  
drwxrwxr-x. 2 jenkins jenkins 8 Aug 22 23:33 .ssh

After this, weâ€™ll generate an ssh key pair and give the new location to save keys:

ssh-keygen -t rsa

Weâ€™ll leave the passphrase empty. Below is a sample run:

\-bash-4.2$ ssh-keygen -t rsa  
Generating public/private rsa key pair.  
Enter file in which to save the key (/var/lib/jenkins/.ssh/id\_rsa): /var/lib/jenkins/Github/.ssh/id\_rsa  
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):  
Enter same passphrase again:  
Your identification has been saved in /var/lib/jenkins/Github/.ssh/id\_rsa.  
Your public key has been saved in /var/lib/jenkins/Github/.ssh/id\_rsa.pub.  
The key fingerprint is:  
62:08:8a:20:fg:g5:36:pn:36:cf:a8:cv:s0:r1:f1:65 jenkins@localhost.localdomain  
The key's randomart image is:  
+--\[ RSA 2048\]----+  
| . =. |  
| oo Oo |  
| o=o= |  
| . .o + |  
| S . = |  
| . . = . E|  
| \* o |  
| . o |  
| |  
+-----------------+  
\-bash-4.2$ ^C

After that, we can get the public key from id\_rsa.pub:

\-bash-4.2$ cat id\_rsa.pub  
ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQCtyO9WjepA/vbU/0m+e2QCibi6NbyugsfARKo3EWWXHU2pitK8hzl034X0BhqHpXOLkEhyM5Thjd5XoNY8YJW+l45SZ5KrchH6W9eM1TpbvxohCxxR3ziWJctvJrvmowteW9ss/Xy+71xxx/J8k1A24z2Rs0CFMopK1PQV8SYWpegfDGyBmHPQNfLvyGV7fe44BTD5KT6mvfF+ImJDHx/jhMI4w+FvPskqJLy25B5/IGVgseB8U6rLptLKqz7zC7Eh2yD6ou33ezEpRHVA2od4+NCbxSeKyEmMB5OtHiNoPH9CaHGWrgdKQp5iOBDGC1LtkCIaGr9AuoBNee3GALJ5 jenkins@localhost.localdomain

We need to copy this value.

### Configure SSH Key for GitHubÂ Project

Once logged in to GitHub, you need to go to the sample repository on which you have access. Go to repository settings -> Deploy keys -> Add deploy key:

Give a name such as â€˜Jenkins Userâ€™ and add the key. You may select â€˜allow write accessâ€™ as well. Since we are using Jenkins only to pull repository, weâ€™ll leave this checkbox unchecked.

### Install Credentials Plugin forÂ Jenkins

We now need to add a plugin called `Credentials Plugin` inside Jenkins, if itâ€™s not already added. For this, login to Jenkins.

Manage Jenkins -> Manage Plugins -> Available and search for `credentials plugin` and install it:

### Add SSH Key insideÂ Jenkins

Now go to Credentials from left pane inside Jenkins console and then click global:

![](../img/0__iD1tCyrVgZ__bhbEo.png)

Then Go to add new credentials.

This will open a new form for us. In the

*   Kind dropdown, select â€˜SSH username with private keyâ€™.
*   Scope dropdown, select Global (Default selection).
*   ID, give an appropriate ID.
*   Description, If you want to add some description here.
*   Username, add user name for added ssh credential.

After that, click ok to save the credentials.

### Install Git on JenkinsÂ Server

If git is not installed on your Jenkins Please install the following plugins.

Manage Plugins > Available and search > install all plugins.

Go to Jenkins job in reference, under source code management section, select the saved credentials title name as we added no above Steps:

Once you have added it, click apply and save. Itâ€™s time now to go ahead and build our job. It runs successfully.

Wohoooo, we successfully configure SSH authentication between Github and Jenkins ðŸŽŠ ðŸŽ‰ðŸ¤–ðŸŽŠ ðŸŽ‰
